Why did I decide to learn Software Engineering? For a long time, I never knew what I wanted. I could just never figure it out, which could be extremely frustrating. When I graduated Highschool I was looking for answers, It was time to figure out what direction I wanted to take my life. Well, 6 months came and went and I felt no closer to my goal than when I started! So, I decided the best option for me was to join the Marine Corps Reserves.

When I arrived back home, 10 months later, I still found myself in the same spot of not knowing what I truly wanted as a career. Through high school, and the rest of these experiences, my friends would always seem to have it figured out. They always knew what college they wanted to attend, what career they wanted, or at minimum an idea for what they wanted to do. And every time, almost without fail, I would pick up whatever skill or trade or career interest they had. I'd adopt it as my own and decide "I'm gonna do that too!", and then again every time a few months would go by and I'd realize it was fake, again! I was chasing other peoples dreams because I couldn't figure my own out.

But then I remembered something. Something that had sparked my interest when I was younger. Something that popped back up in my life, time and time again. Coding! and I knew I found my career path.


There are many things that I found incredible about software development. A fast-paced environment, with problem solving, and variety. A huge career field with a ton of different interesting sounding jobs. Freelancing opportunities, and even just the benefit of having these skills for personal use. A world filled with automation and information, creating all kinds of programs, apps, methods, and functions. The list goes on and on...​

I have heard developers say time and time again " You never stop learning ". Front end, Back end, Data analytics, hundreds of languages. For me, what it really comes down to is freedom. Unlimited opportunities. With every job, your experience grows and your knowledge advances. From the outside looking in, it sure looks like a wild ride that can take you as far as you let it.

These are just a few of the many reasons that I decided that this was the best life for me. Ever since stumbling upon coding when I was 15, I always knew there was something there for me. I never did dive in when I should have, but around 9 months ago I rekindled the fire by randomly thinking about the Codecademy website(which I had seen before) And that was it. Off to the races.​

I tackled HTML and CSS first, and then found some other online resources and stayed in courses. While throughout all of this, as I went deeper and deeper into the world of Tech and software development I fell more and more in love with it.​

Through the frustration of learning new languages for the first time, taking on new concepts, and just taking on the grind of what most of you reading this either are going through with me, or have gone through before... I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The freedom of knowing the language of computers, in a world run on computers.​
